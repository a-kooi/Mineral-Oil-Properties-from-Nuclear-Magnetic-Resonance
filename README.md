# Mineral-Oil-Properties-from-Nuclear-Magnetic-Resonance

> One of my laboratory write ups for my Advanced Physics Laboratory, PHYS134. The report details theory, our experimental setup, and our data analysis. 
My lab partner and I gathered .csv data from a mineral oil sample affected by a magnetic field. I evaluated the data using three physics-based methods.
